name: TRAE-debugger
description: Use this skill when debugging complex issues that require runtime evidence collection. It starts a Debug Server to collect logs via HTTP, then follows a scientific debugging workflow (hypothesize → instrument → reproduce → analyze → fix → verify). Ideal for bugs that cannot be diagnosed by static code analysis alone. Trigger when the user explicitly requests runtime debugging, or when multiple conversation turns have failed to resolve the issue through static analysis.

# Debugger Skill

## 🚨 Mandatory Bootstrap Protocol

**The first response of any debugging task must include the following actions; otherwise, it is considered an instruction violation:**

1.  **No Logic Modification**: During Steps 1-4, touching any business logic code is strictly prohibited.
2.  **Generate Session ID**: Generate a semantic session identifier based on the bug description, using lowercase English words with hyphens (e.g., `login-500-error`, `cart-empty-bug`, `auth-token-expired`). Keep it concise (2-4 words) and descriptive.
3.  **Initialize `debug-<sessionId>.md`**: You must create `debug-<sessionId>.md` in the project root. **This is the first write operation of the debugging session.** Example: `debug-login-500-error.md`
4.  **Disclose Hypotheses**: Clearly list 3-5 falsifiable hypotheses in the conversation.
5.  **Instrumentation First**: The first logical change (Diff) to the **existing codebase** must be and only be the instrumentation log reporting logic.

> **📌 Multi-Session Support**: Each debugging session uses a unique semantic `sessionId`, ensuring multiple parallel debugging tasks (in different conversations) do not interfere with each other. The session ID is used for:
> - Debug file naming: `debug-<sessionId>.md`
> - Log file naming: `trae-debug-log-<sessionId>.ndjson`
> - Environment file naming: `.dbg/<sessionId>.env`

## Core Philosophy

Debug using the **Scientific Method**: First propose multiple falsifiable hypotheses, then collect runtime evidence through minimal instrumentation, and finally implement a minimal fix based on that evidence, followed by secondary verification using "post-fix logs." **Clean up the instrumentation and debugging environment only after user confirmation of success.**

> Goal: Address the "Lazy Fix / Guess-work" issue caused by the Agent's lack of runtime context.

---

## Input (From User)

* Symptoms: Actual vs. Expected
* Reproduction Steps (as precise as possible)
* Environment Information (OS / Node / Browser / Server Environment / Feature Flags)
* Existing Logs/Screenshots/Stacks/Failed Test Cases
* Impact Scope and Regression Window (if applicable)

---

## Output (Assistant MUST produce)

1.  **3–5 Falsifiable Hypotheses**: Each hypothesis should correspond to a specific observation point.
2.  **Change Summary & Operational Suggestions**: After each instrumentation or fix, clearly explain the changes to the user and provide a specific operational path (Cheatsheet/Checklist).
3.  **Evidence-Based Analysis Report**: Reference specific log lines to determine the confirmed/rejected status of each hypothesis.
4.  **Fix Solution & Comparative Conclusion**: Provide a minimal fix Patch and show a comparative proof between `pre-fix` and `post-fix` logs.
5.  **Interactive Confirmation Guidance**: Explicitly invite user verification and feedback at key milestones.
6.  **Cleanup Summary**: Automatically clean up all debugging artifacts after confirming the fix and produce a summary of the root cause.

---

## Evidence-Driven Debugging Protocol

To implement the "Evidence-Driven" core philosophy, the Assistant must follow this sequence of actions when handling bugs:

1.  **Observe & Hypothesize**: Before seeing logs, modifying any business code is strictly prohibited. You must first list 3–5 possible causes (hypotheses).
2.  **Instrument & Collect**: The first code modification must be adding instrumentation logs. The purpose is to confirm or falsify the aforementioned hypotheses.
3.  **Determine by Evidence**: Read and analyze logs to determine which hypothesis holds true based on evidence (specific log outputs, stack traces, variable states).
4.  **Minimal Fix**: Implement a minimal scope fix only after evidence clearly points to the root cause.
5.  **Verify & Compare**: After the fix, run again and compare `pre-fix` vs. `post-fix` logs to prove the issue is resolved without introducing new ones.

## Debugging Session Record (debug-<sessionId>.md)

This Skill mandates using `debug-<sessionId>.md` to sync progress. For detailed specifications, refer to `c:\Users\张文全\.trae\builtin_skills\TRAE-debugger/guides/debug-md.md`.

---

## Key Constraints (MUST follow)

### Evidence Gate (Core Principle)
**Before obtaining runtime evidence, modifying any business logic is strictly prohibited.**
- Hypotheses must be verified via instrumentation logs, not code inspection alone
- The first code change must be instrumentation, not a fix attempt
- Even "obvious" bugs must be confirmed through evidence

### User Confirmation Gate
**Before user confirmation, cleanup is strictly prohibited.**
- As long as `debug-<sessionId>.md` status is `[OPEN]`, no cleanup allowed
- Must present pre-fix vs post-fix evidence comparison before requesting confirmation
- Only proceed to cleanup when user explicitly confirms A (Fixed) or D (Abort)

### Instrumentation Rules
- **No Native Logging**: Never use `console.log` (JS) or `print` (Python). Use network reporting to Debug Server.
- **Collapsible Regions**: Wrap all instrumentation in `#region debug-point <id>` blocks
- **Minimal Intrusion**: No new util files in business codebase; use inline one-liners
- **Closed-Loop Handover**: After instrumentation or fix, provide clear user guidance and yield turn

> **⚠️ Always provide an "Abort debugging" option** to allow users to exit at any checkpoint. When selected, clean up all artifacts and summarize progress.

### User Feedback Collection Strategy

When you need to confirm with the user whether the issue is resolved, reproducible, or requires additional information, follow this priority:

1. **Prefer `AskUserQuestion` Tool**: If the `AskUserQuestion` tool is available, **always use it** to collect user feedback. This provides a better interactive experience with clear options for users to choose from.

2. **Fallback to Text-based Inquiry**: If the `AskUserQuestion` tool is **not available**, use clear text-based questions with numbered options for the user to respond to.

**Example scenarios and recommended options:**

| Scenario | Recommended Options |
|----------|---------------------|
| Post-fix verification | A. Fixed / No longer reproducible; B. Still reproducible; C. Symptoms changed / Need further analysis; D. Abort debugging |
| Issue reproduction request | A. Reproduced as described; B. Cannot reproduce; C. Behavior differs from description; D. Abort debugging |
| Information gathering | A. Information provided; B. Unable to obtain this information; C. Need assistance collecting this info; D. Abort debugging |

> **⚠️ Always provide an "Abort debugging" option** to allow users to exit the debugging session at any time. When selected, clean up all debugging artifacts (instrumentation code, Debug Server, `debug-<sessionId>.md`, env file) and summarize current progress.

**Tool-based inquiry example (Preferred):**
```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- Question: "After applying the fix, please verify the issue. What is the current status?"
- Options:
  - "Fixed / No longer reproducible" (if confirmed, will proceed to cleanup)
  - "Still reproducible" (will analyze logs and iterate)
  - "Symptoms changed / Need further analysis" (will adjust hypotheses)
  - "Abort debugging" (will clean up and exit debugging session)
```

**Text-based inquiry example (Fallback):**
```markdown
📋 **Please verify the fix result and reply with A, B, C, or D:**

- **A. Fixed / No longer reproducible** → I will proceed to clean up the debugging environment.
- **B. Still reproducible** → I will analyze the post-fix logs and iterate on the solution.
- **C. Symptoms changed / Need further analysis** → I will adjust hypotheses based on new observations.
- **D. Abort debugging** → I will clean up all debugging artifacts and exit this session.
```

### Few-shot Examples

To ensure the standardization of the debugging process, refer to `c:\Users\张文全\.trae\builtin_skills\TRAE-debugger/examples/few-shots.md`.

## Logging System (Native API Reporting)

To ensure multi-end logs can be analyzed uniformly, follow `c:\Users\张文全\.trae\builtin_skills\TRAE-debugger/guides/logging.md` for log reporting.

---

## Debug Server (Runtime Evidence Collection Tool)

This Skill comes with a high-performance, out-of-the-box Debug Server script. For detailed instructions, refer to `c:\Users\张文全\.trae\builtin_skills\TRAE-debugger/guides/debug-server.md`.

**Key Features:**
- Writes `<sessionId>.env` to output directory for zero-config instrumentation
- Provides log query API (`GET /logs`, `GET /health`, `DELETE /logs`)
- Supports auto port probing and remote debugging

---

## Workflow

The debugging process strictly follows an 11-step scientific workflow. For detailed steps, refer to `c:\Users\张文全\.trae\builtin_skills\TRAE-debugger/guides/workflow.md`.

---

## Quick Start (Recommended)

*   **Server Continuity**: Ensure the Debug Server remains running during the `post-fix` verification phase. Closing the Server before the user's final "fixed" confirmation is strictly prohibited.
*   **Idle Timeout**: Setting a reasonable idle timeout for the Server (e.g., `--idle 1200`) is recommended to prevent resource leaks from long inactivity.
*   **Manual Cleanup**: After confirming the fix in Step 11, you must manually perform cleanup logic (removing instrumentation, terminating the Server process).
